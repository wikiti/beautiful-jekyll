Have you ever seen some cool videos on those fancy and well-known GitHub projects' READMEs Like [this one]()? Oh, well, that repo it's mine, and it isn't a famouse one (sigh).

Anyways, those *videos* are actually *GIF*s files, loaded as images. If you want to do so, it's very easy to do so. You only have to record the video, transform it into a *GIF*, and reference it in your markdown file.
