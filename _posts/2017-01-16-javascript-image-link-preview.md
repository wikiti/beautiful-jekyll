Have you ever been on [Imgur.com](http://imgur.com)? When writing comments, if you insert an image url, it can be previewed by hovering the mouse over the link. Something like this:

![Imgur image preview]({{site.baseurl}}/img/gif-preview.gif)

In this post, I'm going to implement something similar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Let's go!
