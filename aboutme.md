## About me

It's not about you, it's about me. My name is Daniel Herzog, and I'm:

- A great non-DRY software engineer.
- A videogame pasionate.
- A software engineer.
- Contributor to the OpenSource world.
- A software engineer.
- A software engineer.

Did I tell you that I'm a software engineer?

Joking apart, I'm a junior/senior software developer who is specialized on web applications
(front-end and back-end) and interactive software. I'm currently leaving on Spain (Â¡hola amigo!),
but, if you're searching for paella and flamenco, this blog isn't for you.

## About my work

Everything (or at least the most important) things that I've done are available on my [project's page](http://www.danielherzog.es/es/projects).
